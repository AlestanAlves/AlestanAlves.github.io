                <p widht=300px>I'm passionate about technologies, especially in the areas of Data Science. With 13 years old, create an online game on a local server in Java language, but exclude after a while, the local server couldn't take it.
                I like challenges, books, developing new technologies, using logic and analytical thinking. 
                I have knowledge in: Python, Pandas, Docker, MongoDB, MySQL, Jupyter Notebook, Keras, TensorFlow, Django, HTML, CSS, Git, Linux, MacOS, Windows and agile methodologies.</p>
                <p>Much of the time I am programming in Python which is my favorite language and venturing into Go and Flutter two languages that I am enjoying. My passion is to have fun programming and reading books and materials every day.</p>

                <p>Besides that, something that is really important to me is knowing how to lead well, understanding the difficulties of your team and observing the strengths of each one and inserting to extract the best they can. (I love Star Wars, RPG and sci-fi)</p>
                <p>Let's have a coffee, I'm always open to learn new things and discuss crazy ideas. You can reach me at alestanalves@gmail.com</p>
